Here is a brief overview of color correction in Lens Studio:

Color correction in Lens Studio refers to adjusting the colors in the camera feed from a Snapchat lens to achieve a desired aesthetic or look. 

Some key things to know:

- Lens Studio has various color correction components that allow you to make adjustments like brightness, contrast, saturation, color temperature, etc.
- Common color adjustments include white balancing to address unrealistic color casts from different lighting conditions, enhancing vibrancy or desaturating colors, warming/cooling the image with color temperature and tint adjustments, boosting contrast, and more.
- Color correction is often one of the final steps when developing a quality lens - it's key for making the camera feed colors appear accurate or achieving the intentional style you want for the lens.
- Proper color correction can help make camera elements like facial overlays, 3D objects, etc. blend in better with the camera feed background and look more natural.

In summary, it's an essential process that involves tweaking color values across parameters like brightness, saturation, and contrast that help lenses look visually appealing and as intended. The Lens Studio editor provides various components to allow for granular color adjustments.

Here's a quick overview of face retouching in Lens Studio:

Face retouch refers to using techniques in Lens Studio to enhance, smoothen or edit facial features shown in the camera feed of a Snapchat lens. 

Some key things to know:

- The Face Inset component allows creators to apply a layer of retouching like smoothing, color adjustment, etc. specifically to facial areas captured in the camera.
- The Face Stretch Effect allows for enhancing or changing facial proportions and shapes in creative ways.
- Other effects like textures, blurs, and image filtering also work well with faces for stylized retouching options.
- Lighting adjustments help models' faces look flattering and properly lit instead of dark or uneven.
- For beauty lenses especially, using subtle retouch capabilities to perfect skin, adjust facial tones/textures, shape features like eyes or face, add virtual makeup, etc. is important.
- Going overboard may look very artificial and unnatural though. Maintaining a balanced and nuanced enhancement is key.

Here's a quick overview of noise textures in Lens Studio:

Noise textures refer to image patterns that add random pixilation and grit to parts of a Snapchat Lens for stylistic effect. 

Some key points:

- They give a rough, grainy visual appearance as opposed to being clean and smooth. This could be used to achieve a vintage, grungy, or dirty look.
- Lens Studio includes built-in noise textures like film grain, but custom textures may also be imported.
- They are obtained usually by using grain overlay images, but effects like distortion can make objects appear noisy too.
- Key parameters allow adjusting scale or size, intensity, and animation patterns for the noise grains. This helps control the coarseness of the texture.
- Noise can be applied selectively only to specific objects, materials or parts of the scene rather than the entire lens view. Masking and texture settings allow this control.
- It works well on elements shot with camera-like faces. But computer-generated visuals like 3D objects can also be noise-mapped.

So in summary, noise gives lenses an unpredictable, true-to-life visual imperfection that makes the scene less artificial and more organic and raw. It’s an artistic tool for enhanced realism and dramatic effect.

## `Adding head-filters`

*** Search for the type of filter you want to create *(for example, crown, emoji crown, flowers, butterfly, ete.)* in the form of ‘.png’ image format. 

`{.png → is the type of image format where the images have transparent background}`
